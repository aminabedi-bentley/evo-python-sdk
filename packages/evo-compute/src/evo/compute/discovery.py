"""Discovery client for the compute task catalogue.

``DiscoveryClient`` lists the tasks available to an organization, with the full parameter
and result schemas for each. The catalogue is paginated by the service; this client fetches
every page and caches the combined result with a time-to-live. The convenience accessors
(:meth:`get_topics`, :meth:`get_topic_tasks`, :meth:`get_task`) read from that cache.

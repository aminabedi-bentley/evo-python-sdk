    """Search neighborhood parameters for geostatistical operations.

    Defines how to find nearby samples when performing spatial interpolation
    or estimation. Used by kriging, simulation, and other geostatistical tasks.

    The search neighborhood is defined by an ellipsoid (spatial extent and
    orientation) and constraints on the number of samples to use.

    Kriging, IDW, KNN and declustering can further limit the samples by octant,
    quadrant and drillhole. The other tasks do not support these limits and
    refuse a neighborhood that sets them.

    Example:
        >>> search = SearchNeighborhood(
        ...     ellipsoid=Ellipsoid(
        ...         ranges=EllipsoidRanges(major=200.0, semi_major=150.0, minor=100.0),

        ...     ),
        ...     max_samples=20,
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> # Octant search, using at most 3 samples from each drillhole:
        >>> search = SearchNeighborhood(
        ...     ellipsoid=Ellipsoid(ranges=EllipsoidRanges(major=200.0, semi_major=150.0, minor=100.0)),

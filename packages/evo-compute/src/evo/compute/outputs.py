"""Output hydration: the references a task returns, back as typed objects.

A task's results are references too -- ``{"reference": "<url>", "name": ..., "schema_id":
...}`` for an object it wrote, a JMESPath expression for the attribute it filled in. The
task's published ``results`` schema marks each of those with an ``output`` annotation, which
is all :class:`TaskResult` needs to hand the caller a loadable object instead of a URL::

    result = await client.geostatistics.kriging_gcp.run(...)
    grid = await result.target.load()
    frame = await result.target.to_dataframe()
    estimates = await result.target.attribute.to_dataframe()

An ``output: attribute`` node names an attribute rather than an object, so it carries the
same two annotations the input side uses to place one: ``attribute_from``, a relative JSON
pointer to the object the attribute lives on, and ``attribute_path``, the container each
object family keeps attributes in. A task publishes one expression for every family it
supports, so the container it names can be the wrong one for the object actually written --
:meth:`ResultNode.load` repairs it from ``attribute_path`` rather than reporting a miss.

:class:`TaskResult` and :class:`ResultNode` subclass :class:`dict`, so the raw payload is
still available exactly as the platform sent it -- ``result["target"]["reference"]`` and
``result == {...}`` behave as they did before hydration existed. Attribute access and the
loaders are additions on top, driven entirely by the schema; nothing here is task-specific.

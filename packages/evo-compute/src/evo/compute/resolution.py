"""Reference resolution: friendly Python inputs in, wire-shaped payload out.

Compute tasks address data by reference -- an object URL, a JMESPath expression naming an
attribute, a File API URL. Asking callers to build those by hand is the ergonomic gap the
typed geostatistics tasks close with :class:`~evo.compute.tasks.Source` /
:class:`~evo.compute.tasks.Target`. :class:`ReferenceResolver` generalises that: it reads
the reference annotations off *any* task's published schema, so one walker serves every
task in the catalogue with no per-task code.

The annotations it acts on (the closed vocabulary the platform publishes):

.. code-block:: text

    reference_to: geoscience-object   -> a validated object URL
    reference_to: attribute           -> a JMESPath expression
    reference_to: file                -> a File API URL
    supported_schemas: [...]          -> object families/versions the leaf accepts
    attribute_from: <pointer>         -> which sibling object an attribute lives on
    attribute_path: {pattern: [...]}  -> per-object-family JMESPath container
    target: attribute                 -> a create/update attribute slot
    discriminator: <key>              -> tagged union; pick the branch by the tag

Resolution reuses the very helpers the hand-written runners use
(:mod:`evo.compute.tasks.common.source_target`), so the two paths agree on the wire by
construction rather than by convention. It is also idempotent: a value that is already in
its wire form -- a URL string, a ready JMESPath expression, a ``{"operation": ...}`` dict
-- passes through untouched, so there is nothing to switch off.

``supported_schemas`` is enforced as a hard error when the referenced object's schema can
be established, either from a typed object the caller already holds or from a metadata
download. When the object cannot be loaded (a cross-hub reference, a transient objects-API
failure) the check is downgraded to a logged warning: an availability problem must not
block a job the platform would happily accept, and the platform re-checks server side.
